### Proposal Feedback ### 

- Refine research question, feels chunky when read aloud
- Frame more of the general context and challenge in the intro, provide more of a straightforward explanation of the problem with a focus on specifying the need for online generation
- In final presentation thoroughly establish the background, problem and related work before introducing artifact, more context will make it make more sense
- Look into LaValle's work (bookmarked on home pc) for pathfinding info and explain more about why I am using A*
- Refine hypothesis, differntiate between quality assurance and evaluation
- Explore automated testing instead of peer and supervisor code walkthroughs
- Include Mark Nelson's work on pcg, give more then one industry example to add credibility
- Add more context specific analysis for ethical considerations


### Plan moving forward:

- Implement the tutorial mentioned in proposal for rough prototype with a focus on navigating with mouse and keyboard before implementing A* pathfinding
- Implement quality assurance (unit tests)
- Implement A* pathfinding
- Plan again after this is done
